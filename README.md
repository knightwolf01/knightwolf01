Hey there, I'm sanu kumar singhðŸ‘‹

I'm a final-year computer science student who loves to build things. I'm a full-stack developer, which means I can work on both the parts of a website or app you see (frontend) and the parts you don't (backend). My main focus is on the backend, where I build the powerful systems that make everything work smoothly and securely.

I'm good at solving problems calmly and I try to write code that's clear and efficient. I'm really passionate about creating reliable and secure online tools and making sure they can handle a lot of users without breaking a sweat.

ðŸ’¡ About Me

ðŸ§  currently learning DSA, and enjoys solving DSA problems ...
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about React, Tailwind, JWT, MongoDB, MySQL, and APIs.
